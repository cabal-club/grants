> 1. First, tell us your project's name. 

Cabal.


> 2. Give us your high-level pitch and tell us what problem you're trying to solve

Anyone who has used centralized chat platforms has felt the limitations of their ability to serve users' needs:

- corporate-run servers
  - vulnerable to state surveillance, and
  - corporate monetization of user data
- online only
  - unusable in offline situations (train/plane/river boat/rural community)
  - unusable even when there is a local network, but no internet connection
- ungovernable
  - difficult to create safe spaces
  - users are often left with little control except appealing to the corporation to help in abusive situations

Cabal is trying to be a secure, peer-to-per community chat platform. What this means is, cabal

- works without servers
  - anyone can start a new chat room (cabal)
  - nobody needs to own or know how to run a server to participate or create a cabal
  - servers CAN be set up though, and act like amplifiers to boost the reach of the cabal
- secure
  - all cabals are private and undiscoverable by default
  - messages are end-to-end encrypted, with support for private 1:1 messaging within a cabal
- works great offline
  - offline isn't a special case with cabal; just a normal use case
  - full message history can be read offline
  - messages can be sent offline, and sync to other peers whenever they become available
  - can chat & sync with peers who are on the local network, even if no internet connection is available

Not all of these features are implemented, but make up the core of our roadmap.

> 5. Where is the team based? If distributed, give us a general idea. 

Distributed: USA (west coast; east coast), Sweden, Germany

> 6. If accepted, how will you utilize the grant? 

The grant would be portioned up into three spending funds: Maintenance, Development, Utilities. The funds would be split up with 45% going to maintenance, 45% to development, and the remaining 10% for utilities.

Utilities would be comprised of smaller sums such as renting a VPS to help in testing protocol changes and host a mumble server for our weekly community call. It would also be used for more marketing-related expenses such as printing stickers to be shared at conventions and meetups e.g. the Chaos Communication Congress.

The Maintenance and Development funds would pay individuals for work on the project. The Maintenance fund would pay out a base rate for a 6h work day. It would be a lower rate than the equivalent development work, but it would also last longer. Development milestones (such as implementing a web client) from the roadmap would be split up into sub-goals, and each sub-goal would be roughly estimated at an amount of 6-hour days, which would then be translated into what achieving that sub-goal would pay out. There would be two payouts per sub-goal, half at the start and the other half at the finish. 

We would favour achieving many smaller goals over larger goals, to prevent burnout, make it easier for new contributors to enter the project and to increase the effiency of the payouts. The spending would also be transparently documented in e.g. a git repository (GitLab, GitHub).
