> 1. First, tell us your project's name. 

Cabal.


> 2. Give us your high-level pitch and tell us what problem you're trying to solve

Anyone who has used centralized chat platforms has felt the limitations of their ability to serve users' needs:

- corporate-run servers 
  - vulnerable to state surveillance, and
  - corporate monetization of user data
- online only
  - unusable in offline situations (train/plane/river boat/rural community)
  - unusable even when there is a local network, but no internet connection
- ungovernable
  - difficult to create safe spaces
  - users are often left with little control except appealing to the corporation to help in abusive situations

Cabal is trying to be a secure, peer-to-per community chat platform. What this means is, cabal

- works without servers
  - anyone can start a new chat room (i.e. a cabal)
  - nobody needs to own or know how to run a server to participate or create a cabal
  - servers CAN be set up though, and act like amplifiers to boost the reach of the cabal
- is secure
  - all cabals are private and undiscoverable by default
  - messages are end-to-end encrypted, with support for private 1:1 messaging within a cabal
- works great offline
  - offline isn't a special case with cabal; just a normal use case
  - full message history can be read offline
  - messages can be sent offline, and sync to other peers whenever they become available
  - can chat & sync with peers who are on the local network, even if no internet connection is available
  - first time users will receive all the history when they connect with the others of a cabal

Not all of these features are implemented, but make up the core of our roadmap.

> 4. Do you have a website? A public code repository would do. 

http://cabal.chat, https://github.com/cabal-club/

> 5. Where is the team based? If distributed, give us a general idea. 

Distributed: USA (west coast; east coast), Sweden, Germany

> 6. If accepted, how will you utilize the grant? 

The grant would be portioned up into three spending funds: Maintenance, Development, Utilities. The funds would be split up with 45% going to Maintenance, 45% to Development, and the remaining 10% for Utilities.

Utilities would be comprised of smaller sums such as renting a VPS to help in testing protocol changes and to host a Mumble server for our weekly community call. It would also be used for more marketing-related expenses such as printing stickers to be shared at conventions and meetups e.g. the Chaos Communication Congress.

The Maintenance and Development funds would pay individuals for work on the project. The Maintenance fund would pay out a base rate for a 6h work day. It would be a lower rate than the equivalent development work, but it would also last longer.

Development milestones (such as implementing a web client) from the roadmap would be split up into sub-goals (e.g. create a prototype using WebRTC). Each sub-goal would be roughly estimated at how many 6-hour days it would take to complete, which would then be translated into what achieving that sub-goal would pay out. There would be two payouts per sub-goal, half at the start and the other half at the finish. 

We would favour achieving many smaller goals over larger goals, to prevent burnout, make it easier for new contributors to enter the project and to increase the effiency of the payouts. The spending would also be transparently documented in e.g. a git repository (GitLab, GitHub).

TODO: discuss this

> 7. Tell us your story: how long have you been working on this project, how is the community involved, or any other detail you want.

The project started in April 2018 with the aims of being a distributed Slack replacement. 

Since then we've had contributors come in and create a complete mobile app, redesign the desktop interface, create an irc proxy, or simply contribute small user experience fixes in the various clients. It's difficult to estimate, but we've had probably 20-30 people come in and offer up contributions. The cabal-club GitHub organization itself has 10 members. 

> 8. What is the most groundbreaking thing about your solution?

It is a free, offline, off-grid Slack that requires no servers - only people and their devices. 

> 9. How does your solution further decentralization?

It allows any community to create their own chat platform and without needing to rely on external servers. All they need is the devices they will chat with. Despite not having any servers, anyone joining will still get the entire chat history to read through.

Since it's open source and with an easily modifiable codebase, communities can change existing clients or write completely new ones without needing to rewrite the technically challenging aspects such as the distributed database or the peer discovery.
